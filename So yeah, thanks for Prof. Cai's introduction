So yeah, thanks for Prof. Cai's introduction

I am super excited to join our school and I have already received such warm welcomes from many colleagues as I've started my onboarding. 

Since our school has already sent an email introducing my research, I will very briefly introduce my research interests here as machine learning theories and algorithms that help continually transfer and adaptation of the knowledge learnt previously to solve current tasks with minimal human supervision. This includes continual learning, meta-learning, and transfer learning. Regarding applications, recently I focus on applying these algorithms to drug discovery with small data. I look forward to collaborate with you, if what I am doing interests you.

Outside of work, I would introduce myself as one that loves drawing, running, and piano playing four months ago. But now, you know, my baby completely changes my life. I am definitely a babysitter. So whoever has extensive babysitting experiences, please feel free to share with me :)
